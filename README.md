# Button-in-Processing

im a newbie in processing.
I created a Button class for Processing for my own use...  i thought someone else might find this useful.

Intrested in expanding this class by adding functions for making buttons like closeButtton imgButton which will make the button what the name suggests.

feel free to branch this out to awesome button functions..

Thanks â˜º
